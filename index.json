However, managing the infinite dimensionality of CRMs typically requires practitioners to derive ad-hoc algorithms, preventing the use of general-purpose inference methods and often leading to long compute times. We propose a general but explicit recipe to construct a simple finite-dimensional approximation that can replace the infinite-dimensional CRMs. Our independent finite approximation (IFA) is a generalization of important cases that are used in practice. The independence of atom weights in our approximation (i) makes the construction well-suited for parallel and distributed computation and (ii) facilitates more convenient inference schemes. We quantify the approximation error between IFAs and the target nonparametric prior. We compare IFAs with an alternative approximation scheme -- truncated finite approximations (TFAs), where the atom weights are constructed sequentially. We prove that, for worst-case choices of observation likelihoods, TFAs are a more efficient approximation than IFAs. However, in real-data experiments with image denoising and topic modeling, we find that IFAs perform very similarly to TFAs in terms of task-specific accuracy metrics.","tags":["Source Themes"],"title":"Independent finite approximations for Bayesian nonparametric inference","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1656423000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656423000,"objectID":"8e0c09303fcbaa7f6c74569b964a5c51","permalink":"https://tinnguyen96.github.io/talk/many-processors-little-time-mcmc-for-partitions-via-optimal-transport-couplings/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/many-processors-little-time-mcmc-for-partitions-via-optimal-transport-couplings/","section":"event","summary":"Invited talk at ISBA 2022","tags":[],"title":"Many processors, little time: MCMC for partitions via optimal transport couplings","type":"event"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1648540800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1648540800,"objectID":"423a43a491fefbd7129960969af80ab2","permalink":"https://tinnguyen96.github.io/talk/many-processors-little-time-mcmc-for-partitions-via-optimal-transport-couplings/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/many-processors-little-time-mcmc-for-partitions-via-optimal-transport-couplings/","section":"event","summary":"Oral presentation at AISTATS 2022","tags":[],"title":"Many processors, little time: MCMC for partitions via optimal transport couplings","type":"event"},{"authors":["Tin Nguyen","Brian L.

In finite time, though, slow mixing often leads to poor performance. Modern computing environments offer massive parallelism, but naive implementations of parallel MCMC can exhibit substantial bias. In MCMC samplers of continuous random variables, Markov chain couplings can overcome bias. But these approaches depend crucially on paired chains meetings after a small number of transitions. We show that straightforward applications of existing coupling ideas to discrete clustering variables fail to meet quickly. This failure arises from the ``label-switching problem'', as semantically equivalent cluster relabelings impede fast meeting of coupled chains. We instead consider chains as exploring the space of partitions rather than partitions' (arbitrary) labelings. Using a metric on the partition space, we formulate a practical algorithm using optimal transport couplings. Our theory confirms our method is accurate and efficient. In experiments ranging from clustering of genes or seeds to graph colorings, we show the benefits of our coupling in the highly parallel, time-limited regime.","tags":["MCMC","unbiased estimation"],"title":"Many processors, little time: MCMC for partitions via optimal transport couplings","type":"publication"},{"authors":["William T.

Notably, the choice of GP kernel is often somewhat arbitrary. In particular, uncountably many kernels typically align with qualitative prior knowledge (e.g.\\ function smoothness or stationarity). But in practice, data analysts choose among a handful of convenient standard kernels (e.g.\\ squared exponential). In the present work, we ask:Would decisions made with a GP differ under other, qualitatively interchangeable kernels? We show how to answer this question by solving a constrained optimization problem over a finite-dimensional space. We can then use standard optimizers to identify substantive changes in relevant decisions made with a GP. We demonstrate in both synthetic and real-world examples that decisions made with a GP can exhibit non-robustness to kernel choice, even when prior draws are qualitatively interchangeable to a user.","tags":["Gaussian process","robustness"],"title":"Measuring the robustness of Gaussian processes to kernel choice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tin Nguyen","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"import libr print(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;) Overview The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

A gold standard evaluation technique is structured cross-validation (CV), which leaves out some data subset (such as data within a time interval or data in a geographic region) in each fold. But CV here can be prohibitively slow due to the need to re-run already-expensive learning algorithms many times. Previous work has shown approximate cross-validation (ACV) methods provide a fast and provably accurate alternative in the setting of empirical risk minimization. But this existing ACV work is restricted to simpler models by the assumptions that (i) data across CV folds are independent and (ii) an exact initial model fit is available. In structured data analyses, both these assumptions are often untrue. In the present work, we address (i) by extending ACV to CV schemes with dependence structure between the folds. To address (ii), we verify -- both theoretically and empirically -- that ACV quality deteriorates smoothly with noise in the initial fit. We demonstrate the accuracy and computational benefits of our proposed methods on a diverse set of real-world applications.","tags":["Structured models","Leave-one-out cross-validation"],"title":"Approximate cross-validation for structured models","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1605618000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605618000,"objectID":"fdae6fcc567e0dadccb88b165537bbf0","permalink":"https://tinnguyen96.github.io/talk/independent-finite-approximations-for-bayesian-nonparametric-inference/","publishdate":"2022-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/independent-finite-approximations-for-bayesian-nonparametric-inference/","section":"event","summary":"Contributed talk at BAYSM:O 2020","tags":[],"title":"Independent finite approximations for Bayesian nonparametric inference","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Wowchemy is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.

Furthermore, the computational efficiency of pruning is maintained at both training and testing time despite having to aggregate over an exponential number of subtrees. We believe this is the first subtree aggregation approach with such guarantees.","tags":["PAC-Bayes","decision trees","aggregation"],"title":"PAC-Bayes Tree: weighted subtrees with guarantees","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
